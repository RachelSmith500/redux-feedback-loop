# Feedback App

## Description

This application allows users to be able to provide feedback about their experience while attending Prime Academy. This feedback is provided to instructors so they can have a better understanding of individual student progression. The app collects data regarding the student's feelings on material, the support they're receiving, and their level of understanding. The students can also leave additional comments if they would like. This data is stored in a database after the feedback survey is completed.

## INSTALLATION

Create a database named prime_feedback,
The queries in the tables.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,
Open up your editor of choice and run an npm install
Run npm run server in your terminal
Run npm run client in your terminal
The npm run client command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Usage

In order to use the application you just need to follow the survey's direction. On the first page rate your how you're feeling from 1 - 5 then click the next button. Proceed the same way with understanding and support. Provide any comments that you would like to leave for your instructor. At the end you will be able to review your submission. If every thing looks right hit submit. You can then click leave new feedback to take a new survey.
